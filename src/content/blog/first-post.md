I've always avoided starting a blog for fear of judgment and an obsession with perfection. As such, I have never actually posted anything. I've recently been playing with the idea that there is a distinct possibility that this content is hardly likely to be noticed. I love to learn, but I am frustrated by a distinct lack of tangible, deliverable examples of my learning. This site is far from perfect, and I am uncomfortable with that, but it’s more proof of learning than anything I've accomplished so far. I've started probably 5–10 different blog engines with the intention of doing everything myself, but this is none of that. It’s a minimally customized version of Astro’s blog template hosted on GitHub pages using the default GitHub Actions template. This site is more likely to be used as a personal home page and digital resume than an actual blog, but I would love to practice organizing my thoughts for others to understand at some point.
